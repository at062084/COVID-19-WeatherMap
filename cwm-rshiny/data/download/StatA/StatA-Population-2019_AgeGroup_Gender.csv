"Resident population annual average",".) Scope of statistics Population figures according to population extrapolation by Statistics Austria .) Update Extrapolation data are updated every spring. Last updating of cube [2020-07-06] .) Documentation Directorate Social Statistics - Analysis and Projections Mr. Alexander Hanika, MA, phone +43 (1) 71128 - 7279 Alexander.Hanika@statistik.gv.at Other Metadata: http://www.statistik.at/web_en/statistics/population/population_stock_and_population_change/index.html .) Revision The register based census (census date 31/10/2011) showed a population figure of about 35 000 people less than registered in population statistics at the same date. To ensure consistency with the census results a revision of both population statistics as well as migration statistics was carried out. This revision covers the population stocks for the period from 01/04/2007 to 01/01/2012 as well as the annual average population and migration statistics as well as the demographic indicators for the reporting years 2007 to 2011."
"Age in years","The items of this criterion refer to years completed in life. Until 2015: 95 plus years old"
