Classifications of the group ""classifications - A"" can not be combined among each other. The variables in the group ""classifications - B"" can only be combined with the mandatory field time. .) Origin of data and legal foundations Until October 2014 inclusively, cases of death were collected and processed according to the place of the event on the basis of the reports of the approximately 1 400 Austrian registrar's offices. Since 1 November 2014 death data have been transmitted regularly by the Central Civil Register (ZPR). Until 2008 statistics covered all deaths occurring in Austria of Austrian residentials. With regard to persons having died abroad and having had their main residence in Austria, the use of other data sources have made complete statistical coverage possible since the year under review of 2009. Since reporting year 2015 data on deaths of persons who had their main residence in Austria and died abroad have been transmitted by the Central Civil Register. Regional assignment of the published data is made according to the last place of residence of the deceased person.
